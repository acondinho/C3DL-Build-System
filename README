v0.1 Release
This first release will incorporate two different modes, one being a full version which will combine all files in the library, and a minified version which will only remove all whitespace within the library files

How to run this release
- Download all files off the github repository using the download link
- Either extract to a linux distro or upload to a linux server
- Set proper permissions (chmod 755) for the c3dlbuildbot file
- Run the webUI.html file through a browser
- Once the library has been downloaded import it into whatever c3dl web page you would like to use it on

*You must be using a webgl enabled browser*
*Turn off shader validation in about:config -- search for webgl and set the validation to false*
