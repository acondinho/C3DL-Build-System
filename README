v0.2 Release
The second release of this build system now allows you to specify whether or not you want to include debugging utilities when downloading the C3DL library. The bash script now accepts a second argument either via command-line or through the web interface of "debug" or "nodebug", if none is specified the system will automatically include the debugging utilities just in case.

v0.1 Release
This first release will incorporate two different modes, one being a full version which will combine all files in the library, and a minified version which will only remove all whitespace within the library files

How to run this release
- Download all files off the github repository using the download link
- Either extract to a linux distro or upload to a linux server
- Set proper permissions (chmod 755) for the c3dlbuildbot file
- Run the webUI.html file through a browser
- Once the library has been downloaded import it into whatever c3dl web page you would like to use it on

*You must be using a webgl enabled browser*
*Turn off shader validation in about:config -- search for webgl and set the validation to false*
